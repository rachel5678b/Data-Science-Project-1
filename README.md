## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The motivation for this project was to explore national complications and deaths data following medical events using data published by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). 

1. In general, how do most outpatient and ambulatory surgery centers rate according to the survey?
2. What measures have the greatest impact on whether or not someone would recommend a facility?
3. What measures make a consumer most likely to recommend a facility?
4. What Measures make a consumer least likely to recommend a facility?
